- A system for A.I agents to share knowledge of the enviroment with other agents, based on a social simulation and opinion of each other(i.e. A.I agents have likes, dislikes, factional opinions, etc)
- Support of A.I agents to develop an opinion about the player which can influence their actions
Player Assessment/Analyser/Adjustor:
- A system for observing the players actions in a game, and quantifying them based on the hexad model
- A system that can take the aforementioned observations, and make guesses as to the player's intent
- A system that, upon being notified of the player's intent, adjust the game world to support/discourage that based on developer defined rules
